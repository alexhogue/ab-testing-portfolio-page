      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>A group of participants was tested as they completed a particular task with two different variations of a webpage interface.
        The data for both interfaces was collected as the participants completed a particular in order to test the impact of the interface 
        change on the user interaction. The given task was as follows:

      <p><b>Task:</b> Schedule an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024</p>

          <p class="changes">Interface A has no distinction between the appointment offerings besides the description text itself. Additionally, there
            is minimal button contrast, which limits the legibility of the buttons used to schedule the appointment.

          <p class="changes">Interface B added a background color corresponding to the appointment location. Additionally, the contrast between
            the button text and background was increased as well as differentiation between the "see appointment" and "schedule

            <p class="null"><b>Null hypothesis:</b> A user interacting with interface version A will misclick on the page before 
              completing the task equally on average compared to users of version B.</p>
            <p class="prediction"><b>Prediction:</b> I predict that I will end up rejecting the null hypothesis because I believe the

              users of version B.</p>
            <p class="reasoning"><b>Reasoning:</b> I think the changes to the background colors to correspond with the medical 
              center will encourage users to pay more attention to what they click. I also think the button contrast and improved 
              legibility will make the task clearer to users, and reduce their misclick rate. However, it is also possible that the 
              colors confuse the user, resulting in them misclicking.</p>

            <p class="reasoning"><b>Reasoning:</b> I think that the changes to the UI of version B, such as the higher contrast

            <p class="reasoning"><b>Reasoning:</b> I believe the colored backgrounds as well as the boosted contrast and color 
              differentiation between the buttons will provide visual hierarchy to direct the users to the desired appointment

        <h4>Statistical Findings</h4>
        <div id="findings">
          <div class="results">
            <h5 class="metric">Misclick Rate</h5>
            <div class="conclusions">
              <p>For misclick rate analysis, I used a <b>chi-squared test</b> because analyzing the frequency of a particular item in a set of data, 
              such as TRUE and FALSE, is particularly suited for this kind of test; the data collected for misclick rate is binary, 
              with each instance falling into one of two categories: clicked (true) or not clicked (false). Based on the resulting 
              statistics, the difference between versions A and B with respect to this metric is not statistically significant. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The <b>degree of freedom</b> of 1 indicates that the chi-squared test involves two categorical variables with two levels each.</li>
                <li>The small <b>chi-squared value</b> of 0.014 suggests that there is little deviation between the frequencies in the two groups.</li>
                <li>The high <b>p-value</b> of 0.905 is close to 1, which suggests that any observed differences are likely due to random variation rather 
                  than a true distinction between the test groups.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Based on the data from this test, I reject to fail the null hypothesis.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h5 class="metric">Time on Page</h5>
            <div class="conclusions">
              <p>A one-tailed t-test is appropriate when you have a strong directional hypothesis. So, for this metric, I used a 
                <b>one-tailed t-test</b> as I am testing a specific directional hypothesis (whether the mean of one group is 
                significantly greater than or less than that of the other). Based on the one-tailed t-test results, there is 
                insufficient evidence to conclude that the mean of dataset B is significantly less than the mean of dataset A.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The <b>degrees of freedom</b> of 48.428 indicates the number of independent observations used to calculate the t-score.</li>
                <li>The <b>t-score</b> of 0.538 is less than 1, suggesting a relatively small difference between the means of datasets A and B.</li>
                <li>The <b>p-value</b> of 0.296 represents the probability that group B’s time on the page is less than group A’s time on page. 
                  Even though this is less than a 50% chance, in order to have confidence evidence that B &lt; A, this value should be 
                  around 0.05. So, there is no strong indication that the mean of A is less than the mean of B.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The high p-value suggests that there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis for this test and 
                suggests that any observed difference in means could likely be due to random variation rather than a true 
                difference between the two datasets.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h5 class="metric">Mouse Move <br>Distance</h5>
            <div class="conclusions">
              <p>For this metric, I used a <b>one-tailed t-test</b> because the hypothesis predicts a specific directional expectation 
                about the difference between the two groups (that users of version A will move their mouse farther than users of version 
                B). Based on the results of this test, there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the mean of group B is less than 
                the mean of group A. The low p-value suggests that the observed difference in means is unlikely to be due to random 
                variation, and there may be a true difference between the two datasets.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The positive <b>t-score</b> of 2.4064 suggests that the mean of group A is higher than the mean of group B. 
                  The larger the t-score, the more evidence there is against the null hypothesis.</li>
                <li>The low <b>p-value</b> of 0.0103 for A &gt; B (less than the commonly used significance level of 0.05) suggests 
                  that there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is strong indication 
                  that the results of group B are less than the results of group A.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Based on this analysis of the data, I feel confident rejecting the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h4>Summary Statistics</h4>
        <p>When running an A/B test, it is important to not only look at the output of the test itself but to also understand the 
          general shape and pattern of the data. One way to do this is through evaluation of summary statistics:</p>
        <div id="dataSummary">
          <div class="dataSum">
            <p class="dataHead"><b>Sample Size:</b></p>
            <p class="dataPar">For the group A tests, 34 data points were collected, and for the group B tests, 30 data points were collected. 
              Increasing the sample spaces of the tests would further improve the accuracy and reliability of the results. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="dataSum">
            <p class="dataHead"><b>Time on Page <br>Mean/Median</b></p>
            <p class="dataPar">The median time on page for version A is 8222.5 and the mean is 9729.97. For group B, the median is 
              8613  and the mean is 8699.79. There is not a mode value for the data as none of the values repeat. These statistics 
              reinforce the failure to reject the null hypothesis. Even though there is a fairly significant difference between the 
              two means, the mean of group A is larger than the median, suggesting a right-skewed distribution. The right skew 
              indicates that there are high values pulling the mean to the right, which can be seen when looking at group A’s 
              individual data points; there is one extreme outlier of 56671. In such cases, the median, being less sensitive to 
              extreme values, gives a more representative measure of central tendency. Thus, the two medians for this metric reflect 
              the similarity in the outcomes of both versions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="dataSum">
            <p class="dataHead"><b>Mouse Move <br>Mean/Median</b></p>
            <p class="dataPar">Version A mouse move distance median is 3853.02 and the mean is 3267.09. For group B, the median mouse 
              move distance is 2450.79 and the mean is 2731.42. For this metric, the median and averages are generally reflective of 
              the analysis of the p-value from the results from the t-test. These values reinforce the rejection of the null 
              hypothesis as the results of group B are consistently smaller than those of group A .</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Analyzing these summary statistics not only aids in understanding the trends within each group but also helps to detect 
          unusual patterns that may impact the overall interpretation of the A/B test results. Based on the analyses, I can 
          conclude that the changes made to the interface design do not have a significant impact on user experience; the user in 
          either group made about the same rate of misclicks, and the difference in time spent is not large enough to make a claim 
          about this metric. However, one striking difference between the two groups is difference in the mouse move distance, 
          which was lower for version B. This indicates that the color coded appointments by location or the increased contrast 
          and legibility of the scheduling buttons provided a more direct and clear route to accomplishing the given task. So, 
          while 2 of the 3 metrics did not offer strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the third metric, mouse 
          move distance, provided interesting data that suggests that there is a quantifiable impact on the user experience due 
          to the change to the interface.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="conclusion">
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>A/B testing offers valuable insights into the impact of interface design on user behavior. It emphasizes the need for a 
        holistic evaluation, consideration of multiple metrics, and the importance of specific design elements in influencing user 
        interactions. The reduced mouse move distance for version B users suggests that the changes made to this interface version 
        resulted in a more straightforward user experience. Users were able to navigate and complete the task more efficiently, 
        possibly due to improved visual elements and contrast in the interface. This shows that understanding user behavior 
        patterns, such as mouse move distance, is crucial for optimizing interface design.</p>  
      <p>The project also underscores the iterative nature of interface design. While some improvement was evident in version B, 
        ongoing testing, user feedback, and further iterations are also necessary to refine and enhance the user experience more 
        significantly.</p>
