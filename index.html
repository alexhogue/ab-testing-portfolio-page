      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>One group of participants was tested as they completed a particular task with two different variations of a webpage interface.
        Both groups of data while completing the task was recorded in order to later test the impact of the interface change on the
        user interaction. The given task was as follows:
      </p>
      <p><b>Task:</b> Schedule an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024</p>
      <div id="interfaces">
        <div id="versionA">
          <h4>Version A</h4>
          <img id="versionAImg" src="assets/version_A.png">
          <p>Interface A has no distinction between the appointment offerings besides the description text itself. Additionally, there
            is minimal button contrast, which limits the legibility of the buttons used to schedule the appointment. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="versionB">
          <h4>Version B</h4>
          <img id="versionBImg" src="assets/version_B.png">
          <p>Interface B added a background color corresponding to the appointment location. Additionally, the contrast between
            the button text and background was increased as well as differentiation between the "see appointment" and "schedule
            appointment" buttons.
